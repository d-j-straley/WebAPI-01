This is a Web API project, written in C#, using .Net 8 and interfacing directly to SQL Server through ADO.Net.
This API serves up the required data (and receives the same for new records/updated records) from the matching "RobotClient" project, which is an Angular 16.x project.
I have not made the Client project publicly available at this time.
This backend is really the basic "guts" of an eCommerce site.  It's not the HTML pages, of course, but is the backend logic + database work which could make up a generalized eCommerce solution.
